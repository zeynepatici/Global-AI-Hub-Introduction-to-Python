Keywords and identifiers
When you start learning Python, similar to learning a foreign language like Spanish or Chinese, you will need to get a sense of its key elements. Computers are literal. If you don’t spell it correctly, they will do what you said, not what you meant. That’s why computer code must be clear enough for computers to read and understand. Of course, it will take you time to learn all grammar rules and new words, but at the end of this module you will be able to see the sentence structure and the intention behind the code we will write together.
We start with keywords and identifiers. Simply put, keywords are words reserved for the tasks of the programming language itself. You can think of them as pre-built functions or shortcuts. Instead of having to write a code for these tasks each time, you can use the keywords.
In Python, depending on the version you use, there are about 30 keywords. Let’s check out the keywords we have. All we need to do is type help open bracket and closed bracket and run the code. Then, in the prompt that appears you type keywords.
These are words like ‘True’ and ‘False’, ‘for’, ‘return’ and so on. You don’t have to memorize them all, you will learn them as you write more programs.
When you write code, you will be able to easily recognize the keywords because they will be in different colors.
Can you recognize the keyword in this code? In this example we have the keyword “if”. The “if” keyword tells Python that a condition will follow and if that condition is true, it should execute a certain code. Let’s say my favourite number is 12. We can write a program that checks if it is less than 15. Since 12 is less than 15 the “if condition” is True and Python will print “My favourite number is smaller than 15”. As you can see it is sufficient for us to type the keyword “if” and Python already knew it has to check if the condition is true and execute the code accordingly. There was no need for us to give long instructions.
Because each keyword is already associated with a specific task in Python, they cannot be used for naming variables or functions.
Now that we know which words, we can’t use to create names, let’s have a look at what we can use instead.
When we want to give names, we use the so-called identifiers. Identifiers are very important in programming, and indeed in any language.
An identifier is a user-defined name to represent basic objects in Python. These can be variables, functions, classes, modules, or other. Identifiers give these objects unique identities, which then allow us access to them through their name.
But there are some basic rules we need to follow when we create names. Did you know that Python is a case-sensitive programming language? For example, ‘Name’ and ‘name’ are not the same identifiers. Uppercase or lowercase, underscores or numbers can be used.
Identifiers can also start with an underscore, but not with a number. As we just learned, keywords cannot be used as identifiers. So, you can’t name something for, if, True, False and so on.
Finally, you cannot use symbols such as! (exclamation mark), @, #(hash symbol), $ (dollar sign), or %(percent sign).
Here we can see some examples:
How you combine letters, numbers and underscores is up to you. But here is a little tip. There is a style when creating names in Python, 
it is called “snake case”. Here each space between words or numbers is replaced by an underscore, and the first letter of each word is written in lowercase, 
so it looks like a snake. To recap, we learned that there are about thirty keywords which are shortcuts with a specific meaning in Python that cannot be
used for other purposes. We also know that we can give names to objects by using identifiers, which are words or combinations of words, underscores, and numbers.
